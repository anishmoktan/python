# Introduction

Program = a set of instructions which performs operation on data
- When the program is dealing with data, how it will organize the data in the main memory, is where Data Structures is used. 

Example:
Data = Water
Structure = water bottle, bucket, gallon, etc.

Data Structure = a way of organizing and hold data in some manner so later it can be accessed, queried, or updated easily and quickly. 

Example Data Structures:
Arrays
Linked List
Stack
Queue
Hash Tables
Trees
Heaps
Tries
Graph

Common tasks/operations to perform on data structures are:
Insert
Delete
Search 
Access

Algorithms = a process or set of steps to do a certain task.
e.x.
Searching Algorithm: Process or set of steps to search
Sorting Algorithm: Process or set of steps to sort ina particular sequence
Algorithms are performed on data structures 

Example Algorithms:
Sorting
Searching
Tree Traversal
Graph Traversal
